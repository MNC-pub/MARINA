# MARINA
a multi-tenancy- and redundancy-aware in-network aggregation scheme that improves in-network aggregation performance by employing 1) multi-tenancy-aware aggregation tree construction and 2) top-k data aggregation. In the multi-tenancy-aware aggregation tree construction, MARINA constructs an aggregation tree by jointly considering both the remaining switch resources and the amount of data generated by each application. In addition, in the top-k data aggregation, highly redundant data are preferentially aggregated further to reduce the traffic load under the given switch resources. 

We implemented MARINA on a well-known programmable software switch (i.e., behavioral model version 2 (BMv2)) and programmable hardware switch with Tofino chip.
